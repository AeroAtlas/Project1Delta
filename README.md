# Semi-Random Recommendations
A group project created by Andrew and Ivanna

## Description
Our website helps users find new content to watch or play by randomly suggesting a movie or TV show based on the userâ€™s preferences. 

## Motivation
The idea came when we realized how often we find ourselves re-watching the same old shows and movies or wanting to watch something new but being unable to decide.

## Results
Our website provides users with semi-random recommendations for movies and TV shows based on selected criteria and data gathered from two APIs: The Open Movie Database(OMDB) and Guidebox. The app searches through OMDB for a recommendation based on type, genre, and run time; and then uses Guidebox to make sure the recommended content is available to stream online.

## Improvements
In the future, we would like our website to: 
  * Include user authorization so users can create an account and save their recommendation for later.
  * Allow users to filter content by what is available on the streaming services they subscribe to.
  * Allow users to filter content by average review to allow them more control over their semi-random recommendation.
